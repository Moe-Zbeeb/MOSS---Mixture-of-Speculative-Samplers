We are told that she spent a total of 38 hours to play tag on both days. We can start by finding the number of hours she spent playing tag on Monday and Tuesday separately.\n\nLet's assume the number of hours Julia spent playing tag on Monday is x. Then, the number of hours she spent playing tag on Tuesday would be 38 - x (since the total number of hours is 38).\n\nSince Julia played tag with 19 kids on Monday, it means each kid took x/19 hours. Similarly, since she played with 18 kids on Tuesday, each kid took (38 - x)/18 hours.\n\nAs Julia played tag with the same kids on both days, the time each kid took on each day should be the same. So, we can set up the equation:\n\nx/19 = (38 - x)/18\n\nTo solve for x, we can start by multiplying both sides by 19*18:\n\nx = (38 - x) * 19/18\n\nNow, let's solve for x:\n\nx(18) = 38*19 - x(19)\nx(18) = 722 - x(19)\n18x = 722 - 19x\n37x = 722\nx = 722/37\nx = 19.5\n\nSo, Julia spent 19.5 hours playing tag on Monday.\n\nNow, let's find the number of kids she played with on Tuesday.

Since x = 19.5, we can calculate the time each kid took on Tuesday:\n\n(38 - 19.5)/18 \u2248 1.08\n\nSince Julia played with 18 kids, the total time she spent playing tag on Tuesday would be:\n\n18 * 1.08 \u2248 19.44 hours\n\nBut we know she spent 38 hours in total, so:\n\n38 - 19.44 \u2248 18.56 hours\n\nThis remaining time is spent playing tag on Monday.
