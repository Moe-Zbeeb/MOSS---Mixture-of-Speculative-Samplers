First, let's identify the number of boys and girls. Since the groups were divided equally, we can say that there are 10 boys and 10 girls.\n2. The boys brought back 60 shells each, so the total number of shells brought by the boys is 10 x 60 = 600 shells.\n3. The problem states that the girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. So, the amount of shells brought by the girls is 600 + 4 x 600 = 3000 shells.\n4. Since there are 10 girls, we can calculate the number of seashells brought by each girl by dividing the total number of shells brought by the girls (3000) by the number of girls (10). This gives us:\n\n3000 \u00f7 10 = 300 shells per girl\n\nSo, each girl brought back 300 seashells."], "idxs": [90], "new_tokens": [210], "wall_time": [4.05436110496521]}], "tstamp": 1771553266.8080368}

Since the four turtles are each travelling at half the speed of a kangaroo, we need to find the speed of a kangaroo. Let's call this speed \"k\".\n3. Since the three kangaroos take 18 hours to travel, we can say that the total distance travelled is equal to the speed of a kangaroo multiplied by the time taken: 3k \u00d7 18 = distance.\n4. To find the speed of a kangaroo, we can divide the distance by the time taken: k = distance \u00f7 18. Since we don't know the distance, we'll leave this value as \"k\".\n5.

We can solve for Fawn's books by using substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution.\n\nRearrange the first equation to isolate Anne's books:\n\nAnne's books = Sofie's books - 25\n\nSubstitute this expression into the second equation:\n\n(Sofie's books - 25) = Fawn's books - 12\n\nNow we can solve for Fawn's books:\n\nFawn's books = Sofie's books - 25 + 12\n= Sofie's books + 7\n\nSince Sofie and Anne together have 85 books (Sofie + Anne + Fawn = 85), we can set up the equation:\n\nSofie's books + Anne's books + Fawn's books = 85\n= Sofie's books + (Sofie's books - 25) + (Sofie's books + 7)\n= 3Sofie's books - 18\n85 = 3Sofie's books - 18\n\nNow we can solve for Sofie's books:\n\n3Sofie's books = 103\nSofie's books = 34\n\nSo Sofie has 34 books. Since Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, we can find Anne's books by subtracting 12 from Fawn's books:\n\nAnne's books = Fawn's books - 12\n\nAnd since Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, we can find Sofie's books by adding 25 to Anne's books:\n\nSofie's books = Anne's books + 25\n\nNow that we know Sofie has 34 books, we can find Anne's books by subtracting 25:\n\nAnne's books = 34 - 25 = 9\n\nFinally, we can find Fawn's books by adding 12 to Anne's books:\n\nFawn's books = 9 + 12 = 21\n\nSo Fawn has 21 books."], "idxs": [204], "new_tokens": [500], "wall_time": [9.01651644706726]}], "tstamp": 1771554340.8011804}
