We also need to consider the time she spent playing tag. Since she played for a total of 34 hours, this means she played with the same group of kids for some amount of time on both days.\n\nSince she played with the same group of kids, the number of hours she played with each kid would be the same. Let's say she played with each kid for x hours. Then, for Monday, she played with 12 kids for x hours, which would be 12x hours. For Tuesday, she played with 14 kids for x hours, which would be 14x hours. Since the total time she played is 34 hours, we can set up the equation:\n\n12x + 14x = 34\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n26x = 34\n\nDivide both sides by 26:\n\nx = 34/26\nx = 1.3\n\nSo Julia played with each kid for approximately 1.3 hours.
