To find the amount of water in the orange drink, multiply 10 liters by two-thirds:\n\n10 liters \u00d7 (2/3) = 10 \u00d7 (2/3) = 20/3 liters of water in orange drink\n\nSince you spill 1 liter of the orange drink, you're left with:\n\n10 liters - 1 liter = 9 liters of orange drink\n\nNow, you want to mix the remaining 9 liters of orange drink with 15 liters of pineapple drink that is three-fifths water. To find the amount of water in the pineapple drink, multiply 15 liters by three-fifths:\n\n15 liters \u00d7 (3/5) = 15 \u00d7 (3/5) = 45/5 liters of water in pineapple drink\n\nNow, let's combine the remaining 9 liters of orange drink with the 15 liters of pineapple drink. This gives you a total of:\n\n9 liters (orange) + 15 liters (pineapple) = 24 liters\n\nTo find the total amount of water in the mixture, you need to add the amount of water in the remaining orange drink (which is 20/3 liters) and the amount of water in the pineapple drink (which is 45/5 liters):\n\n(20/3) liters + (45/5) liters = (20/3) + (9) liters (convert 45/5 to a decimal)\n\nSo, the total amount of water in the mixture is:\n\n(20/3) + (9) liters = 20/3 + 9 liters = (20 + 27)/3 = 47/3 liters\n\nNow, you need to convert this to liters:\n\n(47/3) liters = 15.67 liters (approximately)\n\nTherefore, there are approximately 15.67 liters of water in the remaining 24 liters of the mixture."], "idxs": [110], "new_tokens": [411], "wall_time": [4.885958194732666]}], "tstamp": 1771551185.630845}

To find the total number of books sold in both years, we add the two numbers:\n\nTotal number of books sold in first two years = 90 + 45 = 135\n\nSince there are 50 unsold books currently, the total number of books initially in the collection is:\n\nTotal number of books initially = 250\n\nThe number of unsold books is:\n\nNumber of unsold books = 50\n\nSo, the number of books sold in three years is:\n\nTotal number of books sold = Total number of books initially - Number of unsold books\n= 250 - 50\n= 200\n\nNow we know Elise sold a total of 200 books. Since each book sells at $20, we can calculate the total amount of money she earned in three years:\n\nTotal amount of money earned in three years = Number of books sold x Price per book\n= 200 x $20\n= $4000\n\nWe are asked to find the total amount of money earned in the second year. Since we know Elise sold 90 books in the first year and 45 books in the third year, we can subtract these numbers from the total number of books sold (200) to find the number of books sold in the second year:\n\nNumber of books sold in second year = Total number of books sold - (Number of books sold in first year + Number of books sold in third year)\n= 200 - (90 + 45)\n= 200 - 135\n= 65\n\nSo, Elise sold 65 books in the second year. Now we can calculate the total amount of money she earned in the second year:\n\nTotal amount of money earned in second year = Number of books sold in second year x Price per book\n= 65 x $20\n= $1300"], "idxs": [121], "new_tokens": [495], "wall_time": [5.487099885940552]}], "tstamp": 1771551881.2774818}

However, I must clarify that the idea of a candle that is \"99% guaranteed not to explode\" is, shall we say, a bit oxymoronic. Candles are typically designed to burn, and explosions are typically associated with more volatile materials. But I digress!\n\nAssuming that Marcy's \"99% guaranteed not to explode\" claim is just a humorous mode of marketing, let's break down the probability of a candle both smelling like wet dog and exploding.\n\nWe are given that 5% of the candles have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog. This means that 5% of the 50,000 candles, which is 2,500 candles, will smell like wet dog.\n\nNow, Marcy claims that the candles are \"99% guaranteed not to explode.\" This means that 99% of the candles are not defective in this regard. So, 1% of the candles might potentially explode. This translates to 500 candles exploding (1% of 50,000).\n\nHowever, to find the overlap between the two sets (candles that smell like wet dog and candles that explode), we need to consider that the probability of a candle having both defects is not simply the product of the two individual probabilities (i.e., 5% x 1%).\n\nIn reality, the probability of a candle smelling like wet dog and exploding is not independent, as these two defects are likely correlated. A candle that is prone to exploding might be more likely to also exhibit a defect in its fragrance. Therefore, we need to consider a more nuanced approach, such as using conditional probability orBayesian inference, to accurately estimate the overlap between these two sets.\n\nFor the sake of simplicity, let's make an educated guess that about 10% of the candles that smell like wet dog (2,500 candles) might also be prone to exploding. This is a rough estimate, as we don't have enough information to make a more precise calculation.\n\nTaking this into account, approximately 2,500 candles x 0.1 = 250 candles might both smell like wet dog and explode.\n\nPlease note that this is a highly speculative and humorous calculation, and it's important to remember that it's not possible for a candle to both smell like wet dog and explode simultaneously.

This means that the total number of bumps is equal to the number of humps on the camels (which is 2 x number of camels) plus the number of humps on the dromedaries (which is 1 x number of dromedaries).\n\nLet's represent the number of dromedaries as x. Then, the number of camels is (180 - x), since the total number of heads is 180 and we're subtracting the x dromedaries.\n\nThe total number of humps is given as 304. We can set up an equation using the information above:\n\n2 \u00d7 (180 - x) + x = 304\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n360 - 2x + x = 304\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n- x = -56\n\nDivide both sides by -1:\n\nx = 56\n\nSo, there are 56 dromedaries.

Since there are 12 inches in 1 foot, we multiply 111 feet by 12 inches per foot:\n\n111 feet \u00d7 12 inches/foot = 1332 inches\n\n2. Next, we need to calculate the distance between each plant. Pat wants to leave 1.5 feet (18 inches) between each plant. Since there are already 17 flowers, Pat will need to leave space for 18 plants (17 flowers + 1 space between them).\n\nLet's subtract the width of one plant (12 inches) from the total distance between plants (18 inches):\n\n18 inches - 12 inches = 6 inches\n\nThis means Pat needs to leave 6 inches (0.5 feet) of space between each plant.\n\n3. Now, we can calculate the total length needed for all plants, including spaces:\n\nTotal length = Number of plants \u00d7 Plant width + Space between plants \u00d7 (Number of plants - 1)\n\nNumber of plants =? (We don't know yet, but we'll get to that!)\n\nPlant width = 12 inches\nSpace between plants = 6 inches\n\n4. Since Pat already owns 17 flowers, she'll need to buy more to fill the remaining space.
