Again, let's calculate how many cups per chicken she gives:\n\n25 cups \u00f7 3 cups/chicken = 8.33 cups/chicken (approximately)\n\nNow, let's add up the total amount of feed Wendi has given her chickens so far:\n\nMorning: 5 cups/chicken \u00d7 20 chickens = 100 cups\nAfternoon: 8.33 cups/chicken \u00d7 20 chickens = 166.6 cups\n\nTotal feed given so far = 100 cups + 166.6 cups = 266.6 cups\n\nSince each chicken gets 3 cups of feed, we can calculate how many cups Wendi needs to give in the final meal:\n\nTotal feed needed for the day = 3 cups/chicken \u00d7 20 chickens = 60 cups\n\nSubtract the total feed given so far from the total feed needed for the day:\n\n60 cups - 266.6 cups = -206.6 cups (which is not possible, since we can't have negative cups of feed)\n\nThis means Wendi already gave too much feed to her chickens.

The number of new pens he gets is equal to the number of 5-pen sets he can make from the used pens.\n\nFor example, if he uses 10 pens, that leaves him with 15 pens remaining. From these 15 pens, he can create 3 new pens (since 3 x 5 = 15).\n\nSo, he gets 3 new pens from the remaining 15 pens, making the total number of pens he has now: 25 (original pens) + 3 (new pens) = 28 pens.\n\nHe can continue this process with the remaining 28 pens, using them to create new pens until they run out of ink. Since he can mix the ink from 5 empty pens to make one new pen, the number of new pens he gets from the remaining 28 pens is also equal to the number of 5-pen sets he can make from those pens.\n\nLet's calculate the number of 5-pen sets he can make from the remaining 28 pens:\n\n28 pens / 5 pens per set = 5.6 sets\n\nSince he can't make a fraction of a set, he can create 5 sets of 5 pens each and 1 set with 3 pens remaining.\n\nFrom these 5 sets, he can create 5 new pens, and from the remaining 3 pens, he can create 1/2 of a new pen. Since he can't make a half-pen, the remaining 3 pens are useless for making new pens.\n\nTo summarize, Ram gets:\n\n* 3 new pens from the first 15 used pens (making the total 28 pens)\n* 5 new pens from the remaining 28 pens\n* 1/2 of a pen that can't be used to make a new pen\n\nThe total number of pens he gets to have is: 25 (original pens) + 8 (new pens) = 33 pens\n\nSo, Ram gets a total of 33 pens."], "idxs": [122], "new_tokens": [490], "wall_time": [6.351413249969482]}], "tstamp": 1771552014.9982767}

Also, the pyramids are not tilted at an angle of 32 degrees relative to the ground. They are built on the flat desert floor, and their angle is roughly 51.84\u00b0 (with a tolerance of about 0.05\u00b0).\n\nNow, let's focus on the sun's movement. If the sun moves at a rate of 5\u00b0 per hour straight upward from the pyramid, and we assume this is relative to the pyramid's original angle (which is approximately 51.84\u00b0), we can calculate the total distance the sun will move in 10 hours:\n\n5\u00b0/hour \u00d7 10 hours = 50\u00b0\n\nThis means the sun will move 50\u00b0 upward from the tip of the pyramid.\n\nTo find the total angle from the ground to the sun, we need to subtract the original angle of the pyramid from the total distance the sun moved:\n\n50\u00b0 (total distance moved) - 51.84\u00b0 (angle of the pyramid) = -1.84\u00b0\n\nSo, the angle from the ground to the sun will be approximately -1.84\u00b0.\n\nPlease note that this calculation is purely theoretical, as it's impossible to have a house or any structure with a 32\u00b0 tilt.

So, the total distance they drove is:\n\nDistance = Speed x Time = 50 miles/hour x 6 hours = 300 miles\n\nSince they hiked for 1.5 hours, the remaining time they spent driving is:\n\nTotal Time - Hiking Time = 6 hours - 1.5 hours = 4.5 hours\n\nThe Llesis family drove for 4.5 hours, and their speed was 50 miles per hour. Therefore, the distance they drove is:\n\nDistance = Speed x Time = 50 miles/hour x 4.5 hours = 225 miles\n\nNow, let's calculate their hiking speed. Since they hiked at an average speed that is 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed, we need to calculate half their driving speed first:\n\nHalf Driving Speed = 50 miles/hour / 2 = 25 miles/hour\n\nThen, subtract 5 miles per hour to find their hiking speed:\n\nHiking Speed = 25 miles/hour - 5 miles/hour = 20 miles/hour\n\nThey hiked for 1.5 hours, and their hiking speed was 20 miles per hour. Therefore, the distance they hiked is:\n\nDistance = Speed x Time = 20 miles/hour x 1.5 hours = 30 miles\n\nNow, we need to find the total distance they traveled. They drove 225 miles and hiked 30 miles. Adding these together, we get:\n\nTotal Distance = Distance Driven + Distance Hiked = 225 miles + 30 miles = 255 miles\n\nThe Llesis family's vacation spot is 255 miles away from their starting point."], "idxs": [82], "new_tokens": [389], "wall_time": [4.339741945266724]}], "tstamp": 1771553177.395434}
