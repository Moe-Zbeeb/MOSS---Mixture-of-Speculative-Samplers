To find the amount of water in the orange drink, multiply 10 liters by 2/3:\n\n10 liters x 2/3 = 20/3 liters of water\n\nSince each liter of orange drink contains 2/3 liters of water, you have:\n\n20/3 liters of water in the 10 liters of orange drink\n\nYou then pour the orange drink into the 15 liters of pineapple drink, but you spill 1 liter of the orange drink. So, you're left with a total of:\n\n10 - 1 = 9 liters of orange drink\n\nNow, you have a total of:\n\n9 liters of orange drink + 15 liters of pineapple drink = 24 liters\n\nThe pineapple drink is three-fifths water, which means for every 5 liters of pineapple drink, there are 3 liters of water. Since you have 15 liters of pineapple drink, you can find the amount of water in the pineapple drink by multiplying 15 liters by 3/5:\n\n15 liters x 3/5 = 45/5 = 9 liters of water\n\nThe orange drink has 20/3 liters of water, and since you have 9 liters of orange drink left, you can find the amount of water in the remaining orange drink by multiplying 9 liters by 2/3:\n\n9 liters x 2/3 = 18/3 liters of water\n\nNow, add the amount of water in the remaining orange drink and the pineapple drink:\n\n18/3 liters of water + 9 liters of water = (18 + 9*3) / 3 = 33 / 3 = 11 liters of water\n\nSo, there are 11 liters of water in the remaining 24 liters of the mixed drinks."], "idxs": [91], "new_tokens": [389], "wall_time": [4.203117609024048]}], "tstamp": 1771551212.8664699}

Tanya uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance: This means the amount of citrus zest is equal to the amount of fragrance.\n2. Tanya uses the same amount of salt as sugar: This means the amount of salt is equal to the amount of sugar.\n3. Tanya uses twice as much oil as salt: This means the amount of oil is twice the amount of salt.\n4. Tanya uses twice as much salt as zest: This means the amount of salt is twice the amount of zest.\n\nNow, let's use the information we've gathered to solve the problem. Since the amount of salt is equal to the amount of sugar, we can represent the amount of salt by the variable x and the amount of sugar also by x.\n\nSimilarly, since the amount of citrus zest is equal to the amount of fragrance, we can represent the amount of citrus zest by the variable y and the amount of fragrance also by y.\n\nFrom point 3, we know that the amount of oil is twice the amount of salt, which is 2x. From point 4, we know that the amount of salt is twice the amount of zest, which is 2y.\n\nWe are given that Tanya makes enough of the salt scrub to fill a 10-ounce jar each time. This means the total amount of the scrub is 10 ounces.\n\nThe formula for finding the total amount of the scrub is:\n\nTotal amount = amount of salt (x) + amount of sugar (x) + amount of fragrance (y) + amount of citrus zest (y) + amount of oil (2x)\n\nTotal amount = x + x + y + y + 2x\nTotal amount = 4x + 2y\n\nWe are given that the total amount is 10 ounces, so:\n\n4x + 2y = 10\n\nWe can simplify this equation by subtracting 2y from both sides:\n\n4x = 10 - 2y\n\nNow, let's use the fact that the amount of oil is twice the amount of salt, which is 2x. We can substitute this into the equation above:\n\n4(2x) = 10 - 2y\n\nExpanding the left side of the equation:\n\n8x = 10 - 2y\n\nNow, let's subtract 10 from both sides:\n\n8x - 10 = -2y\n\nFinally, let's divide both sides by -2:"], "idxs": [121], "new_tokens": [515], "wall_time": [5.59077525138855]}], "tstamp": 1771552911.770111}

Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, we know that three kangaroos traveling at the same speed take 18 hours to cross the highway. Since there are three of them, we can assume that one kangaroo would take approximately 18 hours to cross the highway too.\n\nNow, we need to calculate the speed of one kangaroo. Let's denote the speed of one kangaroo as \"k\". Since it takes 18 hours for one kangaroo to cross the highway, we can set up the equation:\n\nDistance = Speed \u00d7 Time\nHighway_length = k \u00d7 18\n\nNext, we move on to the turtles. Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, which means their speed is k/2. Since there are four turtles, we can assume that their combined speed is 4 \u00d7 (k/2) = 2k.\n\nNow, we need to find the time it takes for the four turtles to cross the highway. Let's set up an equation:\n\nDistance = Speed \u00d7 Time\nHighway_length = 2k \u00d7 Time\n\nSince the turtles take the same amount of time to cross the highway as the kangaroo (or about 18 hours in this case), we can set up an equation:\n\n18 = (2k) \u00d7 Time\n\nTo solve for Time, we can divide both sides by 2k:\n\nTime = 18 / (2k)\nTime = 9 / k\n\nHowever, we need to remember that we don't know the exact speed of the kangaroo (k). But we can use it to find the relative speed of the turtles. Since the turtles travel at half the speed of a kangaroo, their relative speed is 1/2k.\n\nSo, the time it takes for the four turtles to cross the highway is:\n\nTime = 9 / (1/2k)\nTime = 18\n\nTherefore, it will take four turtles, each traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, approximately 18 hours to cross the highway."], "idxs": [110], "new_tokens": [421], "wall_time": [5.138604164123535]}], "tstamp": 1771552956.4829998}
